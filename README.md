# JuskAskIt
a forum application made with node, express, mongodb, react and redux 

Project is still in development ...

The server side code is almost ready though it lacks some refactoring and file upload logic... <br/>
The client side has not been started or structured yet...
You would see some UI code in client folder which are just for tests...
